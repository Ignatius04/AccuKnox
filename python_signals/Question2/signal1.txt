 Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. 
 This means that the code that triggers the signal and the signal handler both execute within the same thread.


# signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import threading

# Signal receiver to execute when a User object is saved
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_saved_signal(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    current_thread = threading.current_thread()
    print(f"Signal is running in thread: {current_thread.name}")
