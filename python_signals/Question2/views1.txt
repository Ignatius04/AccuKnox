# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import threading

def create_user_view(request):
    current_thread = threading.current_thread()
    print(f"View is running in thread: {current_thread.name}")
    
    # Create a new user instance
    user = User.objects.create(username="john_doe")
    return HttpResponse("User created.")



Expected Output:

View is running in thread: MainThread
Signal is running in thread: MainThread
