By default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller when the signal is connected to database actions like post_save, pre_save, etc. 
This means that if the caller's transaction is rolled back, the signal's actions will also be rolled back, and vice versa.

# signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from myapp.models import Profile

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Create a related profile when a user is saved
    print("Signal received, creating profile...")
    Profile.objects.create(user=instance, bio="Auto-created profile")
    print("Profile created.")
