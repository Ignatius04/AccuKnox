Django processes the signal synchronously by default. 
The view will not return a response until the signal handler completes its task.


# signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import time

# Signal receiver to execute when a User object is saved
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_saved_signal(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received for user: {instance.username}")
    # Simulate a long-running task
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Signal handler finished processing.")
