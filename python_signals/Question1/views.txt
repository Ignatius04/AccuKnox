# views.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

def create_user_view(request):
    # Create a new user instance
    user = User.objects.create(username="john_doe")
    print("User created.")
    return HttpResponse("User created.")


Expected Output:

>>User created.
>>Signal received for user: john_doe
# 5-second delay due to time.sleep in the signal handler
>>Signal handler finished processing.
